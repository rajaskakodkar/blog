Hey there! :wave:, I am Rajas Kakodkar.

I am a random Software Enginner. My current employer is [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/in.html) where I work on [Tanzu Framework](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework). I am actively involved in the [Kube Proxy Next Gen](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kpng) working group in the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) ecosystem. I also contribute to the Kubernetes project in Special Interest Groups like Testing and Network. In the past I have worked at [Persistent Systems](https://www.persistent.com/). I also hold interest in [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) particularly in [fastai](fast.ai).

I work remotely from [Goa, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa). When I am not coding, I am a foodie, a car enthusiast and a guitarist!

I am known as rajaskakodkar on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajaskakodkar), [Github](https://github.com/rajaskakodkar) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajaskakodkar/). I reply to @rajas on [kubernetes slack](https://slack.k8s.io/). The best way to reach out to me is to drop an email at hello@rajaskakodkar.dev.
